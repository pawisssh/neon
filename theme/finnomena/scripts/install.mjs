 * DEPRECATED forwarding shim — the canonical installer now lives at
 * scripts/install.mjs (repo root), routed through the canonical theme
 * assets in theme/cds/, theme/css/, and the starter assembly function in
 * scripts/lib/assemble-starter.mjs. This file exists only so callers still
 * invoking the old theme/finnomena/scripts/install.mjs path keep working
 * for one more release; it forwards argv and exit status unchanged and
 * implements no installer logic of its own. Remove in a later announced
 * compatibility change — do not add a second implementation here.
