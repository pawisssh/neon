/**
 * Immersive Layout (Figma node 732:1461) — full-bleed Content only. No
 * Sidebar (the Sidebar View itself is `hidden="true"` in Figma, not just
 * zero-width), no Inspector (also `hidden="true"`). For focus/distraction-
 * free screens — a full-screen editor, a walkthrough, a single-task flow.
 *
 * Confirmed directly against Figma frames at every tier's boundary widths
 * (sm 320/499, md 500/987, lg 988/1079, xl 1080/1271, xxl 1272/1439, xxxl
 * 1440, max 1920 — 2560/3840 not yet checked). Sidebar/Inspector stay
 * hidden and the 64px logo-only header is constant at every tier, but two
 * things are NOT constant, contradicting what this file used to claim
 * from reading only the xxxl frame:
 *
 * - Bottom Navigation is visible at sm (full width, 64px tall) — hidden at
 *   every other tier. Same sm-only handoff SimpleLayout/ContentLayout's
 *   consumers already use; this pattern needs it too since Sidebar is
 *   hidden here at every tier, not just sm.
 * - Content stops being full-bleed at max: at 1920px it caps at 1440px
 *   and centers (240px side margins), rather than filling the viewport.
 *   Not yet confirmed whether that cap holds at 2560/3840 or grows further.
