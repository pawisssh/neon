/**
 * Pane specs for the 5 named layout patterns from Figma (file
 * C9Usn2yP1dRpE9iTxyW3B2, Core Components), by breakpoint tier. Renamed
 * from appShellPanes.ts (which held only the Detailed Layout spec) when
 * the other 4 patterns were added.
 *
 * Sourced from Figma get_metadata reads at the 1440px (xxxl) frame for
 * each pattern — NOT from theme/tokens/breakpoint.json's own per-variant
 * numbers, which model a different, single-active-pane concept (only one
 * of Content/Inspector is ever nonzero per variant) and don't reliably
 * predict actual pane VISIBILITY in Figma (confirmed: e.g. Simple Layout's
 * token data has Inspector as the nonzero pane, but the real frame shows
 * Content visible and Inspector `hidden="true"`). Pane visibility below
 * comes from Figma's own `hidden` attribute, not the token export.
 *
 * Sidebar width is NOT duplicated here — read it from
 * ../theme/breakpoints.config.ts's `sidebarWidth` field. Note: the raw
 * Figma frames for Content Layout and Multi-column Layout showed a
 * slightly different sidebar width at the 1440px frame (320px) than
 * Detailed/Simple Layout's 360px, which matches breakpoints.config.ts's
 * xxxl value — likely minor drift between component variants in the
 * source file, not an intentional per-pattern difference. Using the
 * shared breakpoints.config.ts value everywhere for a visually consistent
 * app shell across patterns; flag to the design owner if this should
 * actually vary per pattern.
 *
 * Only the 1440px (xxxl) frame was read per pattern — other breakpoints
 * are extrapolated using the same sidebar hidden/rail/full progression and
 * "hide non-essential panes on narrow viewports" pattern already
 * established and verified for Detailed Layout. Re-verify against fresh
 * screenshots at other breakpoints before treating as pixel-final.
 *
 * Update: Content Layout's extrapolation has since been confirmed against
 * the real Figma frame at both the min- and max-width of every tier (see
 * its own comment below) — every value matched. Simple, Detailed,
 * Immersive, and Multi-column Layout are still only confirmed at xxxl and
 * remain extrapolated elsewhere.
