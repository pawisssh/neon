# Working on Neon

This repository distributes skills, theme assets and a CDS starter. It is not an employee application.

- Read `design/FINNOMENA.md` for current visual policy. Use CDS for implementation; functional layouts favor restrained, task-led composition; immersive layouts may be colorful. Preserve the provisional status of token mappings.
- Read the relevant skill and its callers before editing. Keep entrypoints concise with fast paths and read conditions; move setup details into reachable conditional references. Audit is optional for unclear integration, not a mandatory gateway.
- Preserve scope: existing apps reuse providers/routes/services; colors-only stays colors-only; composition defaults to preserve and adapts only on explicit request, separately from styling tier; review-only stays read-only. Reuse explicit or established brand intent.
- Treat `theme/tokens/` as raw exports. Generated files are produced by `theme/scripts/`; `color-overrides.ts` and `theme/css/theme.css` are maintained separately. Do not claim they regenerate together.
- Run `node --test evals/skills/*.test.mjs` and `node scripts/check-repository.mjs` after changing distributed resources or packaging. For behavior changes, add a meaningful regression case. For skill changes, exercise realistic employee requests and record evidence limits.
- App/template/theme changes also need an assembled disposable app build and relevant visual/interaction checks. Static reference checks cannot establish UI quality.
- Keep generated apps, screenshots, dependencies and local evaluation artifacts out of the tracked source. Use `.local/` or a temporary directory.
- See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for validation and release preparation. Do not publish merely because packaging succeeded.
