# Review checks by evidence and scope

Select checks for the employee's request; this is not a requirement to review every dimension on every task.

## Evidence limits

| Evidence | Supported conclusions | Still requires other evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Screenshot | Visible clipping, hierarchy, labels, captured state and apparent color use | Keyboard behavior, semantic names, other viewports, exact font loading, unmeasured contrast |
| Source | Verified declarations, event wiring, semantic markup, token references | Computed cascade, actual focus path, successful interactions, rendered dimensions |
| Live UI/DOM | Observed layout, computed styles, accessible names, tested focus/navigation states | Unvisited routes, unavailable states, backend correctness, full accessibility conformance |
| Supplied test results | What that specific run checked | Current behavior after later changes; checks outside the run |

Describe evidence as supplied versus independently observed. If only source is available, identify conditional risks as such instead of claiming a visible failure. Separate hypotheses needing reproduction from confirmed findings.

## Brand consistency

Use the current design reference, not remembered values. Inspect the semantic role, not just a matching hex string: error/positive states and chart categories are not interchangeable decorative colors. Respect explicit colors-only scope and existing intentional structural dimensions. A CDS dependency or raw pixel value is not itself a review finding.

For typography reviews, distinguish a declared font from a loaded font. Check computed styles and font resources when available; inspect Thai and Latin glyphs, long labels, numeric alignment, and wrapping. Do not label a missing font from screenshot appearance alone.

For color mapping disagreements, identify the documented rule and actual mapping. If the design reference and token mapping conflict, report an unresolved reference conflict rather than deciding an authoritative replacement without evidence.

## Responsive behavior

Use provided viewport requirements. Otherwise sample a narrow and wide viewport (375px and 1440px are useful starting points), then inspect relevant transitions if the app changes panes/navigation. Record actual widths, not a claim that all breakpoints were covered. Check horizontal overflow, clipped Thai labels, sticky elements obscuring controls, and access to collapsed regions.

Single-width screenshots cannot establish responsive behavior. Inspect existing/specified theme modes; do not count absent dark mode as a defect unless required by the task.

## Accessibility and interactions

Where runtime evidence permits, check visible keyboard focus, logical order, accessible names for icon-only controls, label/error association, dialog focus/escape/return behavior, and access to the main task without a pointer. Measure foreground/background contrast with a suitable tool and actual colors before quoting a ratio. These checks do not constitute a comprehensive accessibility certification.

Inspect loading, empty, error, disabled, selected, and success states only where relevant and available through safe test data or existing previews. Never trigger a real approval or transaction merely to see a success screen. A missing screenshot of a state does not prove that state is unimplemented.

## Finding example

**High — Header menu trigger (keyboard test, 375px/light).** The menu trigger cannot be reached by Tab, preventing keyboard users from opening primary navigation. Evidence: observed tab sequence skips the trigger; verified source uses a clickable div without keyboard handling. Fix: use a semantic button with an accessible name and retain the existing open handler. Recheck: Tab reaches it; Enter/Space opens the menu; focus returns when closed.

This is an illustrative format, not a finding about the reviewed app. Use verified source paths/lines or screenshot/DOM locations for actual reports; omit unavailable coordinates rather than fabricate them.
