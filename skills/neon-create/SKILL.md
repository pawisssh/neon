# Build Finnomena features with CDS

## Purpose

Deliver the requested content and interactions with real `@coinbase/cds-web` components and Finnomena tokens. Functional screens use restrained navy/white and indigo highlights; immersive pages can be colorful.

## When to use

Use for React/CDS implementation. Preserve an explicitly requested non-React framework and use its normal feature workflow plus Neon's CSS styling path. A request to review does not authorize implementation.

## Fast path

If the app already has a working Finnomena CDS theme, start with the requested component, service and interaction. Reuse its shell, providers, routes and customized theme; skip scaffold, installer and provider setup. Reuse established scope without another tier question.

## Workflow

1. Identify the target, main task and relevant states. Inspect only missing app evidence. Use the [shared contract](../neon-audit/references/workflow-contract.md) if scope/routing is unresolved; conflicting preserve/change instructions require clarification. Resolve Neon resources two levels above this skill's real directory.
2. Read the relevant [design guidance](../INSTRUCTION.md#composition) for visual choices. Select functional or immersive independently of framework. In existing UI preserve composition unless change is requested.
3. Build with existing services and verified CDS exports/prop types. Use semantic color, spacing and radius keys; configure component-specific treatment through supported configuration or scoped wrappers. Do not invent imports, tokens or backend behavior.
4. Implement task-relevant loading, empty, validation, pending, error/recovery and success states, driven by real conditions — never a manual state-switcher shipped in the UI. Only add a visible mock/demo disclaimer when the user's request explicitly asks for a demo or mock-labeled build; otherwise ship a production-grade UI and report mocked or missing integration in the Done summary instead. A starter alone is not a feature.
5. Run the [shared verification](../neon-redesign/references/verification.md), applying only relevant additions. Inspect actual output; report unavailable checks rather than claiming them.

## Conditional references

- New project: [scaffold and layout](references/scaffold.md). Never scaffold over a nonempty app.
- Theme/provider/dependency changes: [CDS integration](references/cds-integration.md). Preserve customized files and theme-mode ownership.
- Complex feature states or existing-app integration: [new UI workflow](references/new-ui-workflow.md).
- Font, mode, migration or installer conflict: the matching section of [theme integration](../neon-audit/references/theme-integration.md).

## Done

Deliver working requested UI, its location/preview, checks performed and material limitations. Keep provisional mapping, mocked services and unverified runtime behavior distinct from confirmed results.
