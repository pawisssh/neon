 * Confirmed (against the real @coinbase/cds-web@9.26.1 types) that
 * MediaQueryProvider does NOT accept a custom-breakpoints prop — its only
 * props are `children` and `defaultValues` (a one-time initial snapshot,
 * not a breakpoint config, per dts/system/MediaQueryProvider.d.ts). This
 * plain matchMedia-based hook is the correct approach here, not a
 * placeholder pending verification — see neon-starter/SKILL.md's known
