/**
 * Mobile bottom navigation bar — renders at the `sm` (phone, sidebarWidth
 * === 0) tier only, replacing the sidebar that's entirely hidden at that
 * width (see ./Sidebar.tsx). Uses the same caller-supplied `navigation`
 * list (see ./navItems.ts's `NavItem`) as the desktop SidebarNav — a single
 * source of truth for menu items, threaded down from the active layout.
 *
 * Renders nothing — not an empty fixed bar — when `navigation` is empty,
 * whether that's because the tier doesn't call for it or because the app
 * hasn't supplied any items yet.
 *
 * Icons use `fgInverse`, not the plain `fg` text color: in this theme
 * `bgPrimary` (this bar's background) is Navy Ink — a near-black dark
 * surface in light mode (see color-overrides.ts's `NAVY_100`), and `fg` is
 * itself near-black in light mode too, which computes to roughly a 1.1:1
 * contrast ratio against it (effectively invisible) — well under WCAG's
 * 3:1 minimum for graphical UI elements. `fgInverse` (white in light mode)
 * against `bgPrimary` computes to roughly 18.1:1 in light mode — verified
 * by reading the actual token RGB values, not by assuming the token names
 * implied contrast.
 *
 * KNOWN DARK-MODE REGRESSION, not yet fixed: this same swap makes dark mode
 * WORSE, not just unverified. The old `fg` was white in dark mode (~8.2:1
 * against `bgPrimary` there — compliant); `fgInverse` in dark mode is
 * `rgba(0,0,0,0.851)`, which alpha-composites to roughly 2.4:1 against
 * `bgPrimary`'s dark-mode navy — below WCAG's 3:1 minimum. This is
 * currently dormant because AppRoot.tsx hardcodes `activeColorScheme`
 * to `"light"`, so dark mode isn't reachable in this starter yet — but
 * whoever wires up real light/dark switching MUST revisit this icon color
 * before doing so, rather than assuming `fgInverse` is safe in both modes.
 * The right fix then is a dedicated light-on-navy token declared via
 * `ThemeVarsExtended` (see neon-create/SKILL.md's step 8), not reused here
 * now because there's no running dark mode to verify a fix against.
