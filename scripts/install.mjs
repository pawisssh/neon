/**
 * install.mjs — deploys Finnomena's CDS theme into a target project.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node install.mjs <target-dir> --new         # scaffold a new project
 *                                                # (starter + canonical theme,
 *                                                # via assemble-starter.mjs)
 *   node install.mjs <target-dir>                # theme an existing project
 *                                                # (full CDS)
 *   node install.mjs <target-dir> --css-only     # copy theme.css only
 *                                                # (no CDS install)
 *
 * --new:          assembles templates/vitejs-cds/ + the 4 canonical CDS
 *                 files (theme/cds/) into <target-dir> via
 *                 scripts/lib/assemble-starter.mjs, then installs the
 *                 assembled app's declared dependencies. Refuses to run
 *                 into a non-empty directory (assembleStarter's own check).
 *
 * (default):      copies the 4 canonical CDS files (theme/cds/) into
 *                 <target-dir>/src/theme/ (or --theme-dir, if given),
 *                 installs @coinbase/cds-web (pinned to the version range
 *                 declared in templates/vitejs-cds/package.json) if not
 *                 already a dependency. Never touches provider wiring or
 *                 component code.
 *
 * --css-only:     copies only theme/css/theme.css into <target-dir>/src/theme/
 *                 (or --theme-dir, or wherever the project keeps global
 *                 styles). No @coinbase/cds-web install, no React provider
 *                 needed — just CSS custom properties.
 *
 * --sync-starter: RETIRED. templates/vitejs-cds/ has no tracked theme files
 *                 of its own to sync — assemble-starter.mjs supplies them
 *                 fresh at assembly time from theme/cds/. Exits nonzero
 *                 without touching the filesystem.
 *
 * --theme-dir <project-relative-dir>: overrides the default "src/theme"
 *                 destination for (default)/--css-only. Both the default
 *                 destination and an explicit override go through the same
 *                 resolveThemeDir check, which validates the resolved path
 *                 stays inside <target-dir> before anything is written —
 *                 rejects absolute paths, paths that resolve outside
 *                 <target-dir>, and paths that pass through a symlinked
 *                 ancestor that resolves outside <target-dir>. This applies
 *                 even when --theme-dir is never passed (e.g. a symlinked
 *                 default "src/theme"), so a failure here does not always
 *                 mean --theme-dir was used. Not accepted with --new: the
 *                 scaffolded starter's own source (AppRoot.tsx etc.) imports
 *                 theme files from a fixed "src/theme" path, so moving that
 *                 destination would silently break the scaffolded app.
 *
 * --package-manager <npm|pnpm|yarn|bun>: overrides package-manager
 *                 detection (see project-config.mjs's selectPackageManager)
 *                 for --new's post-scaffold install and (default)'s CDS
 *                 install. An explicit value's shape is validated up front,
 *                 before any filesystem mutation, in every mode — including
 *                 --css-only, an existing CDS dependency, and --skip-install,
 *                 none of which ever invoke a package manager themselves —
 *                 so an invalid value is rejected even in modes that would
 *                 otherwise just copy files and exit cleanly.
 *
 * --skip-install: scaffold/copy files but never invoke a package manager.
 *                 Applies to --new and (default), the only modes that ever
 *                 run an install. The console output explicitly reports
 *                 dependencies as not installed — this flag must never
 *                 produce an unqualified "Done" success message.

 * apps/portal/) typically has neither on its own: the lockfile and the

 * back to npm — which would plant a stray npm-generated lockfile inside a
 * pnpm-managed monorepo. Intermediate grouping directories (e.g. a bare
 * apps/ with no package.json of its own) are common too, so this climbs
 * through directories with no manifest at all rather than stopping there.
 *
 * Checks startDir itself first, then each parent in turn. At each
 * directory: if it carries ANY evidence (a lockfile, or a declared
 * packageManager), returns it immediately. Otherwise, if the directory
 * itself contains a `.git` entry (a directory for a normal repo, or a file
 * for a git-worktree checkout), stops and gives up — `.git` is used purely
 * as a walk boundary here, not as a check that this is actually the
 * project's workspace root; it never validates workspace membership, it
 * just marks a point past which the walk won't climb. Otherwise continues
 * to the parent directory, giving up once the filesystem root is reached
